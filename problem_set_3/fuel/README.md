# Fuel gauges

Fuel gauges <https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/3/fuel/> is a Python Exceptions problem challenge, that indicates with fractions, how much fuel is in a tank. For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.. As per 

In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
  
"In a file called nutrition.py, implement a program that prompts consumers users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the FDA’s poster for fruits, which is also available as text. Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., strawberries, not strawberry). Ignore any input that isn’t a fruit."
