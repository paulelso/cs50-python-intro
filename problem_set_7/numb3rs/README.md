# NUMB3RS

NUMB3RS <https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/7/numb3rs/> is a Regular Expressions problem challenge that implements a function called validate that expects an IPv4 address as input as a str and then returns True or False, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.

Structure numb3rs.py as follows, wherein you’re welcome to modify main and/or implement other functions as you see fit, but you may not import any other libraries. You’re welcome, but not required, to use re and/or sys.
